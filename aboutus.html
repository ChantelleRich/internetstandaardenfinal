        <h1>About us!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the only anime podcast channel where we have an <strong>all-women panel!</strong> We’re a passionate group of anime lovers, here to explore and celebrate what makes anime unforgettable. Let's dive into the world of anime together and <strong>GEEK OUT!</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Why Anime?</h2>
        <p>
            We believe that anime is not just entertainment. It’s a way to explore emotions, cultures, and relationships. As women in the anime fandom, we’re here to offer our perspectives, highlight the powerful women in anime, and dive into the themes that resonate with us. We want to create a space where people can talk openly about anime, without judgment, and enjoy the magic of shared passion.
        </p>

        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
            We are three friends who discovered a shared passion for anime and became even closer because of it. We all came from different backgrounds, but anime was the thread that connected us. While anime has always been a big part of our lives, it was the connection it fostered between us that truly ignited our desire to create this podcast. With each episode, we aim to celebrate anime in all its forms, from the well-known to the weird, and share our thoughts, laughs, and insights with fellow fans. We realized that anime had created a unique space for us to share, connect, and grow as friends. <strong>Now, we want to bring that energy to you!</strong>
        </p>
